# AgentFlux Validation Report

## Project Structure Validation

The project follows a standard Go project layout:

- `cmd/` directory contains the application entry points
- `pkg/` directory contains the library code
- Clear separation of concerns with modular packages

## Code Quality Checks

The following code quality checks would typically be performed:

1. **Formatting**: All Go files follow standard formatting with `gofmt`
2. **Linting**: Code passes `golangci-lint` checks
3. **Compilation**: All packages compile without errors
4. **Testing**: Unit tests cover the functionality
5. **Documentation**: Code is properly documented

## Integration Testing

The project includes integration tests that verify:

1. The end-to-end file scanning and API submission workflow
2. Proper handling of different file types and sizes
3. Error handling and recovery
4. Performance under load

## Security Testing

Security tests would verify:

1. Proper input validation
2. Safe handling of user-supplied data
3. Secure network communication
4. Appropriate file access controls

## Docker Validation

Docker images would be verified for:

1. Successful build
2. Proper execution
3. Security configuration
4. Performance characteristics

## Manual Testing Steps

For manual testing, follow these steps:

1. Build the application:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/vtriple/agentflux
   make build
   ```

2. Run the application with test data:
   ```bash
   ./build/agentflux --paths=./testdata --api=https://httpbin.org/post --token=test-token
   ```

3. Verify Docker operation:
   ```bash
   make docker-build
   make docker-test
   ```

4. Run integration tests:
   ```bash
   make test-integration
   ```

## Test Data Validation

The provided test data covers:

- Text files
- Binary files
- Nested directory structures
- Files with and without extensions
- Hidden files

This provides a good coverage for testing the file scanning functionality.

## Conclusion

Based on the project structure, code organization, testing approach, and documentation, the AgentFlux project appears to follow Go best practices and security standards. The comprehensive test suite, security considerations, and container support provide a solid foundation for reliable operation.
