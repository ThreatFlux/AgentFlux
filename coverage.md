| pkg/common/fileutils | 87.3% | 85% | ✅ GOOD |
| pkg/common/logging | 86.8% | 85% | ✅ GOOD |
| pkg/common/pathutils | 94.1% | 85% | ✅ GOOD |
| pkg/api | 30.4% | 85% | ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| pkg/dedup | 22.9% | 85% | ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |
| pkg/processor | 28.0% | 85% | ❌ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT |

## Improvement Strategy

To improve code coverage in the packages that currently have low coverage, we have implemented several additional test files with more comprehensive test coverage:

### API Package

Key areas that need more testing:
- SendResults function (73.9%)
- addToBatch function (84.6%)
- sendBatch function (78.6%)
- Error handling paths

Improvements made:
- Added tests in client_test_improved.go for more complex workflows
- Added error handling tests
- Added test cases for context cancellation

### Dedup Package

Key areas that need more testing:
- Deduplicate function (97.1%)
- Error handling

Improvements made:
- Added tests in dedup_additional_test.go
- Added context cancellation tests
- Added tests for invalid deduplication types

### Processor Package

Key areas that need more testing:
- processFile function (74.2%)
- Edge cases

Improvements made:
- Added tests in processor_additional_test.go
- Added tests for string extraction, scanning functions
- Added tests for worker behavior and interruption

### Scanner Package

Key areas that need more testing:
- scanPath function (48.9%)
- processFile function (80.0%)
- shouldExclude function (87.5%)

Improvements made:
- Added tests in scanner_additional_test.go
- Added tests for symlink handling, file size limits
- Added tests for context cancellation

## Next Steps

To reach 90% coverage across all packages, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Fix test execution issues**: Ensure the improved test files are properly executed. This could involve:
   - Checking for proper test function naming conventions
   - Resolving any dependencies or conflicts between tests
   - Ensuring the test files are included in the test runs

2. **Add more targeted tests**:
   - For pkg/api: Focus on the SendResults, addToBatch, and sendBatch functions
   - For pkg/dedup: Improve test coverage by running more test cases through the Deduplicate function
   - For pkg/processor: Add more tests for processFile edge cases
   - For pkg/scanner: Focus heavily on improving coverage of the scanPath function

3. **Consider code refactoring**:
   - Some complex functions like scanPath in the scanner package might benefit from refactoring to make them more testable
   - Breaking down complex functions into smaller, more focused functions can make them easier to test thoroughly

4. **Mock external dependencies**:
   - Use mocks for file system operations to test error conditions more thoroughly
   - Create mock HTTP servers for testing API client behavior

5. **Use test coverage tools**:
   - Regularly run the coverage tools to identify specific lines of code that are not being executed by tests
   - Focus on the functions with the lowest coverage first
